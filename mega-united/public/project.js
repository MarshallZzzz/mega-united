        description:"Mega United successfully transformed two existing 8,900 sq. ft. steel warehouse buildings into a modern regional training center for construction trade workers on Guam. The project involved demolishing the old structural slab-on-grade and rebuilding the interiors using a combination of wood and concrete flooring, along with new gypsum board walls to convert the buildings into two-story classrooms and office spaces. Infrastructure upgrades included storm drainage, waste removal, and landscaping—completed in strict accordance with project specifications and EPA requirements—as well as asphalt paving of the parking lot with full traffic markings and signage. Electrical and communication mainlines were extended from the street power pole via a hardened manhole to the buildings. Each structure was fully refurbished with high-quality air conditioning and exhaust fan systems, commercial-grade lighting, and a comprehensive fire alarm system. Interconnected telecom and internet systems were installed, ready for provider hookup. Unique foldable high-quality partitions were also added to enable flexible use of classroom spaces for both educational and conference purposes. The completed project now serves as a fully functional and professionally outfitted training hub for Guam’s growing construction workforce.",
